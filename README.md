# Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_ML

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques, focusing on Tesla's stock as an example.

**Overview**
The project aims to predict future stock prices by leveraging historical stock data and machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Usage**
**Data Preprocessing:** Run the stock_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and formatting.

**Model Training:** Train machine learning models using the prepared data. The notebook includes code for training a linear regression model.

**Visualization:** Visualize historical stock prices, predicted values, and model performance using the stock_prediction.ipynb notebook.
